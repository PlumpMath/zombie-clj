# Zombie CLJ

An zombie themed web game made with Clojure and ClojureScript live in the
norwegian screencast series [zombieclj.no](http://www.zombieclj.no).

## Firing up the game

Zombies are just a `lein run` away.

## Running the tests

We're using midje. `lein midje` works, and so does `lein midje :autotest`.
